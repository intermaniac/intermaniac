                      <p>There's a big misconception as to what NFTs can be used for because critics, press, and even NFT Twitter are mostly focused on existing use cases and implementations.

NFTs are a fundamental building block for a new Internet, akin to what HTML and HTTP were in the 1990s. ðŸ§µ<br><br>Clearly, this was something that 99.9% of the world did not need at the time of invention. In the early days (and today) HTML was just a standardized way to represent content for web pages.<br><br>The HTTP protocol dictated how data was securely exchanged between a web server and a client (the browser you are using to read this tweet).

Together, HTML and HTTP allowed for the creation and consumption of basic web pages, a new building block for the then unknown Internet.<br><br>Fast forward some months and years and you had early websites. Queue the critics:
 
"Why do I need to read the news online when I have newspapers?"
"No one will ever buy something online without going to a store?"
"Talking to strangers online is creepy"<br><br>In fact, it wasn't just individual web businesses that received flak. The entire Internet was seen by many as a useless technology. And...for awhile the critics were right. <a href="https://t.co/wfbl7V2qdM">https://t.co/wfbl7V2qdM</a> was a hilarious flop. Countless other companies raised millions and went to $0. <a href="https://t.co/87EaloeoLd">https://t.co/87EaloeoLd</a><br><br>But...history has shown that the pundits were wrong and the early adopters and visionaries were right.

From the basic building blocks of rudimentary websites, innovative entrepreneurs spawned entirely new sub-industries within the Internet, each of which is transformative today.<br><br>Amazon is a $911B market cap company in the sub-vertical of e-commerce. Twitter was just purchased by our savior @elonmusk for $44B and is one of the best sources for real-time news and investment alpha. It's just a fraction of the social networking sub-vertical. <a href="https://t.co/W3ZzO5DVmK">https://t.co/W3ZzO5DVmK</a><br><br>While @YouTube and @netflix required many other enabling technologies (e.g. networking infrastructure, CDNs) to stream video to billions of users, they are still built off of these base building blocks that were invented in the first age of the Internet.<br><br>Today, many people think of NFTs as just very expensive digital art. How can anyone justify spending 5, 6, or even 7-figures on a Jpeg. NFTs are for 50 IQ users surely right? There's never going to be a use case besides rampant speculation right? @BoredApeYC is a scam right?<br><br>Wrong. NFTs are a fundamental primitive in Web3. NFTs afford us with true digital ownership, digital scarcity, and digital provenance. In time, they will be pervasive across  gaming, e-commerce/fashion, real estate, tickets, access passes, etc.<br><br>In-game items and currencies will be represented by NFTs in the future. There are already multi-billion dollar economies around games and the Apple appstore and Google Play. When games make items interoperable and more easily tradable in liquid marketplaces, watch out.<br><br>Physical items will be represented digitally with NFTs. We saw @AzukiOfficial recently pioneer the PBT token standard in their successful golden skateboard auction.<br><br>At my company, @OriginProtocol, we recently partnered with @rsonchain to sell a $175k home as an NFT.

<a href="https://t.co/tXnARdSwCC">https://t.co/tXnARdSwCC</a><br><br>NFT tickets will solve ticket scalping and reward creators more effectively. We've seen celebrities and influencers use NFTs to engage with their super fans. Access is utility that previously money couldn't buy.<br><br>What's even more exciting is the unknown unknowns. When the Internet first started, no one could imagine the new use cases and impact that it would bring 10, 20, or 30 years later. Innovation takes time.<br><br>Many people forget that the Internet was technically invented 10 years before HTML was with the creation of TCP/IP. This is analogous to NFTs being invented several years after smart contract platforms (Ethereum) and decentralized ledgers (Bitcoin) were invented.<br><br>I'm excited to see what happens when new NFT standards and tooling are created in the next few years. Marketplaces for trading, fractionalization, NFTs backing physical and digital goods, etc. are just the start. I'm even more excited for NFTs to be abstracted away.<br><br>In a few years, hundreds of millions if not billions of Internet users will interact with and own NFTs without realizing they are called NFTs. This is just like how the majority of the population doesn't need to understand how websites work. Invisible tech = best tech.<br><br>I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is by betting on this industry with my company and our Origin Story product (<a href="https://t.co/PbaD5VtFB5">https://t.co/PbaD5VtFB5</a>). NFTs will be the driver that will propel the success of our team, creator partners, end users, and token holders ($OGN).<br><br>I'm also willing to throw down 1 BTC in a bet against any skeptics (limit 10) that doubt NFT technology will not result in at least $100B of new value creation in the next decade. 

Reply to place your bet against me and we can figure out how to make this happen.<br><br>That's it for now. In future threads, I'll do deep dives on NFTs in the industries I mentioned (gaming, physical, real estate, etc.) and also talk about the interplay between DeFi and NFTs.
