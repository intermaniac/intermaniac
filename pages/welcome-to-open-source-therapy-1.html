                      <p>Welcome to open source therapy #1

Here’s what I learned about my relationship with open source users:

I am so completely burned out on helping people thanklessly for years upon years in GitHub issues and instant messaging. The ones who don’t pay, and even the ones who do.

🧵👇<br><br>Our business is called Convex Cooperative and we’re a socialist oddity that is trying to defy capitalism but will instead probably be quashed because of our idealism. This business is our economic utopia<br><br>You see, we want to work when we want to work, where we want to work, for however long we want to work, on exactly what we want to work on.

And that’s a pretty hard thing to make money doing lol.<br><br>But even more than that, we don’t even really want to think of it like work. In fact, we’d prefer calling it something else. Capitalism snatched away the fun of computers, but we’d like to try to somehow rediscover that and then do what sounds interesting.<br><br>We’d also like to do absolutely nothing whatsoever if that’s what our bodies or minds need from us. We want to be creative when we’re creative and not try to create when it’s time to go on a walk and then take a nap at 10am<br><br>Some would call us lazy or antiwork. I don’t know what if call us. I think we’re just several really privileged people canniving together to try to make our lives better. And getting easy, passive money flowing in makes life easier.<br><br>We know we’ll have to compromise and engage in exploitative capitalism to do so, but want to do that less than other companies. We’re trying hard at it but it’ll probably fail idk. Capitalism is a bitch.<br><br>But yeah, Convex Cooperative is what I’m putting my economic hopes and dreams into. What I’m hoping works out. It won’t be what I hope for in my utopia but maybe it’ll be better than stiff corporate hierarchy that attempts to mechanically create fun with thousands of team budgets<br><br>We’re hoping that life is center main while work is a sometimes interesting side hobby. (Yeah I know, to be that rich is pretty disgusting honestly, when you think systemically about poverty)<br><br>This is my current objective. I don’t claim it’s a noble one whatsoever. I am acting quite selfishly. I want a good life and am trying to have it. Even though there’s a whole bunch of other shit going on around me that’s so crushingly depressing that it’s hard to think about<br><br>For the single-spa people, they’ll get a really reliable and high end Microfrontend hosting cloud service. It’ll have my attention and that of other experts. You can even get support for it. And it won’t suck, it’ll be high end. No more open source garbage quality<br><br>That product is called Baseplate and if you want to give me your dollars right now for it to make sure we actually follow through and do it right, I wouldn’t say no to you.

Here’s the recurring donation link. We need tens of thousands:

<a href="https://t.co/kQPCJZI9e4">https://t.co/kQPCJZI9e4</a><br><br>If you’re side-eyeing me with an offer to be an investor, but also saw what I said about venture capital, I first would like to congratulate you for reading such a long twitter thread you had no business reading. Well done 👏

But the price is so high, you can’t afford me<br><br>You can DM me and talk to me a bit about trying to own part of the company, but you’re getting reversaled here. I’m the one dictating the terms and venture capital is worth around 10% (no 80%) of economic control over a business. No voting rights.

I don’t think we’ll get along.<br><br>Really the only kind of money we’d take right now is from future customers. Companies who want the best possible microfrontends and are willing to take a bet on the single-spa creator with some serious cash to get first dibs and feedback on what Baseplate has to offer.<br><br>Get your company to fork over some serious money and I’ll engage meaningfully with you to make sure that Baseplate suits your needs well. Now is your chance.

But otherwise, no I will not consider yielding even economic control of our co-op to you. Voting rights are off the table<br><br>The only kind of help we’d take is labor but that one is also tricky because we bring everyone on as a fully equal board member. It’s a lot of trust

Even if you were qualified or motivated or both, you don’t have the time to give us because we don’t have the money to pay you yet<br><br>So really, it’ll just be awhile before we’re ready for you. We’re sustainable but small and only work when it makes financial sense to. It’ll be a while.

Once it is ready, though, I truly hope it can be a happy marriage where I’m happy and the single-spa users are happy<br><br>You see, I like software. And I even still like open source software. I only like it when it’s fun. But I’m relearning how to have fun with it. And once I do, that blaring ego of mine will produce some of the finest software of all time.

Haha okay maybe that’s speculative<br><br>This now ends my open source therapy session. This truly is me trying to process and work through my experiences with open source. I tried to be real with you and hope you enjoyed it. To me, the healing is worth more than any money from Baseplate. Because this has been difficult<br><br>The End.
