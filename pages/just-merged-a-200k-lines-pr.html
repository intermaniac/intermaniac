It has been a few weeks that I have been working on migrating our entire code base @MantyData from Flow to Typescript. And now the deploy just finished with a green CI and a seamless experience for our users.

How we did it ðŸ§µ 
#Typescript #WebDev<br><br>First, some context.

We are a 5 year old SaaS compagny with a ~100k lines code base with parts of it being a bit legacy.
We are a team of 7 engineers with many on holiday and several new recruits joining our ranks very soon, so it was crucial to pull this off before that.<br><br>The first decision we had to make was the migration strategy we wanted to adopt.

We thought about migrating manually, but that would have take a very long time and would have resulted in two separate type systems that are not compatible, which could eventually break the product.<br><br>Same goes for an automatic but modular migration.

For all these reasons, we thought the best way to migrate was doing it all in once. Rehearsing the process several times and training to have a green CI in the shortest number of steps so that nothing goes wrong.<br><br>Then came the long journey of browsing and comparing the different codemods (tools to programmatically translate code) available for this kind of migration.

And there were many.<br><br>We finally chose the codemod written by @airtable's engineers to migrate their codebase.

@calebmer article about the migration was of great help in our endeavor to achieve this huge task.

Thank you for sharing.

<a href="https://t.co/gvApHAENts">https://t.co/gvApHAENts</a><br><br>Their codemod had several advantages compared to others.

It had a greater grasp of flow's features thanks to @calebmer's experience working on flow at @facebook.

It used atomic changes that were always understandable when taken separately.<br><br>It used the strengths of flow to annotate Typescript code.

In this example, we loose type safety when changing from flow to Typescript.

@airtable's codemod uses the flow CLI to ask flow what it thinks the type is in these situations and annotates the TS code adequately. <a href="https://t.co/H1SGp8f8Kg">https://t.co/H1SGp8f8Kg</a><br><br>For all the $FlowFixMe and $FlowIgnore comments we had in the code base, we made the codemod change them to @ts-expect-error along with the original comment to keep the developer's intent.

Often, the $FlowIgnore were used to signal a false negative that flow was detecting<br><br>We also had to adapt the codemod to our code base and clean some parts of our code to prepare for the migration.

For example, the codemod was written before flow introduced enums, so it didn't handle them.<br><br>We solved this by moving all our enums in a single file and migrating it manually, i.e. just changing the extension from .js to .ts since the syntax is exactly the same.

And with the export { } from 'file/path'  syntax, we could minimize the amount for imports to change.<br><br>With all this, we had a full TS codebase. Now we needed to make it compile.

We used babel since the beginning of the project so it made sense to keep it, especially given how well it works with TS.<br><br>Babel can compile TS files, and it does so by stripping the typing to produce normal javascript. This gives blazingly fast build times.

In parallel, we use the TS compiler to check for type errors without emitting any javascript or declaration files.

Before / After <a href="https://t.co/6mgb4xmuvg">https://t.co/6mgb4xmuvg</a><br><br>Now the Typescript project compiles and works perfectly on local environment. But to get it to production, we still have to deal with the ~2k5 type errors that Typescript just uncovered.

Here's the approach we took.<br><br>Since, like @airtable, we didn't want to change the compiled code, we chose to ignore all the errors, even the most trivial ones.

After all, all these errors were already there, it's just that flow never knew about them.<br><br>We wrote a script that ran through all the errors the TS compiler was raising and:

If it was an unused @ts-expect-error, deleted it.
Otherwise, it added a @ts-ignore with a [TS migration] flag<br><br>One tricky thing was to detect if we were inside JSX code or not and add the right kind of comment syntax.

I wrote one of my ugliest code for this one off script with way too many regexes. But hey, it worked for 2447 out of 2449, so I am fine with it.<br><br>The last CI step to tackle was the e2e tests. And, miraculously, they passed on the first try without even touching them. I thought these kind of things happened only in fairy tales.<br><br>Finally, we arranged a QA plan where we could rehearse the migration process and test that all the critical features of the product are working. And they were.

And when the agreed upon day came, we froze master, migrated and merged in about an hour, without any complications.<br><br>The process was less painful than expected, and most of this was thanks to the quite strict migration principles that @airtable chose and that we followed as well.

Thanks again to everyone involved in building their codemod and to @calebmer for his article describing the process<br><br>We still have many challenges to come @MantyData to build great products for french government agencies and we are recruiting all kinds of tech positions.
