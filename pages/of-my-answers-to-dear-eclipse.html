                      <p>Thread of my answers to #DEAR_ECLIPSE Q&amp;A <a href="https://t.co/60F0PhW7lH">https://t.co/60F0PhW7lH</a><br><br>1. moonlight chicken actually. i was watching the trailer and the eclipse one was under it. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>2. favorite episode is episode 6 &amp; 9. favorite scene is the one where ayan asks akk to be his bf and the one where ayan fixed akk’s hair. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>3. «  why is growing up so tough, sometimes i just dont want tomorrow to come » #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>4 - a mix of akk and ayan bc i was a perfect and even like our struggles are really similar but i always stood up and raised my voice in unfair situations and also im very flirting and sudden so both.  #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>5. i think ayan fell in love at first sight with akk bc of his visuals and tbh hes so true for that. more than that i think he saw and understood that akk wasnt really himself while being a perfect so he wanted to find the real akk behind the perfect. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>as for akk he also fell at first sight and tbh ayan flirted so much with him that he couldn’t really resist it even tho he tried. in difference akk did want to repress his feelings bc of their differences but ayan made him so safe and happy that he finally let go. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>6. khan problem was accepting his feelings and being scared of rejection more than everyone knowing if u get what i mean. the second he accepted them he became the most confident bisexual on this planet and couldn’t care less about what people said #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>7 - i don’t think they will become a friend group. i do think namo will be added to akk khan and what friendship but thua and wont be part of it. they will just be the boyfriends that hang out with the group from time to time. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>as for ayan &amp; thua ayan could never go back to being bff with thua with what he did. he is a very good kid so he accepted his appology but could never forgive. i dont think they hang out just the both of them but they get along when they hang out with their bfs #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>8 - i always said that the curse was fake and made out by the school so i was right on that. i also sais thua was the one behind it. the thing i was wrong about was dika’s reasons behind his death. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>9 - i think so. knowing ayan is his fiancé nephew touched chadok right part of his brain. kind of woke him up and realized how his shitty ass things made him lose his bf. so he will want to change things in the school #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>10 - i always stand up for injustices and myself and i almost lost my perfect position a lot bc of that. they expected me to shut up bc i was a part of them but i didn’t. i would have found thua in a day and confronted him (privately) right away. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>11 - honestly just ep11. wouldnt have made thua out them and would have made the revelation even bigger. i wanted that revelation to create chaos in the school. would have also put a fight between khanthua and delete the bl part. other the show was perfect for me &lt;3 #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>12 - akkayan will go to akk’s home to study for their final exams. we’ll also get an intimate scene. the eclipse will happen the day of the final exam &amp; we will get a kiss of both couple at that time. chadok will want to change things and happy ending #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>13 - akkayan will go to the same uni with different major. they will have share a dorm and will have small fights here &amp; then but they will live together forever and have excellent communication. tbh i think their eachother first and last love. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>for khanthua they’ll also move in together. they are way too different  and thua selfishness will really create fights between them so they will break up and go back to eo a lot of time but will end up breaking up definitely at the end of the 2nd year. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>14 - over the moon is the obvious one but i love this song so much #DEAR_ECLIPSE</p>
