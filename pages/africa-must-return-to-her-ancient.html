                      <p>Africa Must Return To Her Ancient Spirituality To Unlock Advanced Science And Technology: A Book Chat With Ugo Eze, Author Of The Book ‘Python And The Rainmaker’

*A Thread* <a href="https://t.co/Scy0bT4hEX">https://t.co/Scy0bT4hEX</a><br><br>I mean, I was reading editions of Time Magazine at seven, not to mention The Economics, National Geographic, and others. Even though I didn’t understand everything I read then.

I am often found in the middle of trying to make a living and doing what I enjoy doing.<br><br>I like to research knowledge. I am seriously a tech person, a programmer, an engineer and more, but that's primarily to provide myself with the resources to do what I like; this kind if research.<br><br>During the Osama bin Laden crisis, something came up about what really happened to the building. My brother was in Hong Kong then because he was part of the team that built the Hong Kong Airport.<br><br>In a discussion, he said he didn't think it was just airplanes that brought down the buildings.

Then, in a similar talk, some crazy Americans insisted that America never went to the moon, that it was a faked mission.<br><br>The first thing that occurred to me was why I never thought of that possibility. I was shocked that such doubt never crossed my mind while I was taught physics then in my secondary school and university.<br><br>I downloaded documents on NASA and started researching the Apollo Moon Mission. Someone from the Soviet Academy of Science did a detailed analysis of the amount of fuel the Apollo was carrying and the rate of combustion, then attempted to prove the Apollo couldn’t have reached..<br><br>the Moon and couldn’t have had enough fuel for its return journey.  

I told myself if things like this could be a lie (not that it is), what else is a lie, in doubt, or undiscovered? 

In the course of my investigation, a fellow programmer, Samson, informed me that..<br><br>his granddad was a rainmaker. I asked him what he was doing with Python programming since his granddad made rain. My investigations led me to his granddad and other shamans in different parts of Nigeria. My intention wasn’t to publish a book,<br><br>but I finally decided to document my findings in Python and the Rainmaker.

The book connects Python - the programming language, Python - the snake, the dibia, the shaman, the rainmaker, and science; one would find it difficult connecting this. But you showed it in the book.<br><br>The rainmaker controls water cycle, lightning, and thunderbolts, to make or stop rain, such power, how do you think it can affect the continent in reality and the growth of the tech sector?<br><br>You wouldn't call it two types of science, the science as you know it, from the West, is based on dead energy; say waves, electricity, capacitor, and more, they don't have life in them. There's a different kind of science that is based on psychic energy, the human energy field:<br><br>an energy field, which can be swayed with the mind, with thoughts.

This science is not made of dead energy. What we think as traditional science is based on this kind of science; psychic energy. But this field can be subtle.<br><br>It is hard to control because everyone has this psychic energy and influences the environment consciously or unconsciously. It has the feedback side, which can have a negative effect. There is also an ethical aspect that seems to guarantee one’s safety.<br><br>It appears this psychic field is operational when people pray.

This field is a part of the state-of-the-art research in most top-secret labs in advanced countries. These researches are classified. In fact, in '07 the Central Intelligence Agency released a memo that tried...<br><br>stopping further studies in this area, though they would continue to monitor related projects and researches worldwide.  

The reason is simple: anyone who succeeds in making a breakthrough in psi research becomes the new superpower.<br><br>Officially, psychic powers do not exist, but unofficially enormous effort is being made to understand, control and militarize it.  

What you mean is that breaking through in Psi and paranormal science will change the face of everything?<br><br>It definitely will. And the funny thing is, according to my research, it's Africans who hold the key to this, and not the said advanced nations. Current research does not produce repeatable results.<br><br>Traditional groups such as the Igbos, the Yorubas, the Egyptians, etc., seem to understand the architecture of this field; they seem to understand the correlation between an owl and night and death.<br><br>These are very complex systems with a certain kind of feed-forward of causation and retro-causation.<br><br>Click The Link Below To Read The Complete Article: <a href="https://t.co/XTjO1aY43R">https://t.co/XTjO1aY43R</a> <a href="https://t.co/W5fuwSbdGg">https://t.co/W5fuwSbdGg</a></p>
