                      <p>Companies make tons of mistakes getting their staff to learn #Python üêç.

Here are five of the biggest I've seen over my 20+ years teaching Python at companies around the world.

A long thread... üßµ<br><br>They don't take advantage of comprehensions, generators, or even Python's object-oriented facilities, not to mention decorators and the standard library.

Bottom line: If you know another language, then it'll take you less time to learn Python. But less time ‚â† no time.<br><br>2. We'll just have them watch a Udemy course, or YouTube videos.

Yes, because employees with busy schedules and pressing deadlines will definitely take time to watch these online courses, just because you say that they should.<br><br>I've been in such companies.

I've gone there to teach Python courses after such plans have failed miserably. The companies got them subscriptions to Pluralsight, unlimited books, and even set aside hours for them to watch videos. 

It didn't happen.<br><br>Part of the problem is that people are busy. But they often don't believe they need help.

They can just go to Stack Overflow and  find an answer to their problem. Well, perfect except that it needs an adjustment here. And there. And ... it's good enough, even if not perfect.<br><br>Is that how you want your company's software to be developed?

Just as you cannot pretend to speak a language by using a phrasebook, you can't solve problems with Python with Stack Overflow.<br><br>3. Our people are smart! Your course takes most people four days, but our people can do it in just two.

Years ago, a radio show used to claim that in their town, all of the children were above average. 

We call this the "Lake Wobegon Effect."<br><br>I find that companies all claim to have above-average employees, all smarter than  other companies I've taught at.

Never mind that I teach some of the smartest and best engineers in the world, many of whom have advanced degrees.<br><br>My students are smart, hard-working, and motivated. But they don't know Python. 

And learning Python, like any subject, takes time and practice. That's what my courses offer.<br><br>So sure, I could speak at 2x speed ‚Äî if you've heard me lecture, then you know it's true! ‚Äî and not give any exercises or feedback.

But that's not a class; it's an in-person YouTube channel. And it won't get the job done.<br><br>4. Load up the syllabus

Sometimes, companies ask me to put everything in one course. "In four days, we want to cover data structures, functions, comprehensions, objects, generators, decorators, threads, processes, asyncio, and regular expressions."<br><br>Could I teach such a class? Yes, I could. But me rushing through slides (or live-coded examples) isn't teaching, it's just talking. And it's ineffective.<br><br>Learning takes time. It takes explanations. It takes examples. 

And it requires that the person learning make mistakes, in an environment that I call "controlled frustration," without the pressures of work hanging over their head.<br><br>I actually remove content from my courses each year, moving it into other courses. 

I find new ways to explain and practice the material, such that students get a deeper understanding of the concepts.

After removing content and adding exercises, my courses get higher ratings.<br><br>A long list of topics isn't a course. And it's not a way to teach Python to your employees.<br><br>5. Ignore the importance of interactions

The covid-19 pandemic has pushed many companies to online training. I'll be honest, it's convenient in many ways, including being able to reach people around the world and the lack of a commute.<br><br>But with my students online, they're able to turn off their cameras, ignore exercises, and avoid asking questions. 

Without interactions with my students, I certainly have a harder time teaching ‚Äî but they also have a harder time learning.<br><br>In-person courses are still the best.

But if you're going to go online (and there are many good reasons to do it), then make sure that people are prepared to have their cameras on, to ask lots of questions, to participate, and not to do other work.<br><br>Otherwise, it becomes a YouTube livestream, not a course ‚Äî which is a shame, because the instructor is there to make things clearer for the students.<br><br>Some of my clients have asked me to give final exams after my courses, so that we can ensure that people are paying attention. The tests leave a bad taste in everyone's mouth, but there's no doubt that they ensure people pay attention more.<br><br>Anyway, these are the five things I've most often encountered.

What have you seen, either as an instructor or as a course participant?</p>
