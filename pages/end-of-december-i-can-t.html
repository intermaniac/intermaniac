                      <p>END OF DECEMBER THREAD

I can't believe it's the end of the year already. It's time to do another one of these! 

(Starting next year, I'll be writing my End of Month posts on my WordPress site. I hope you'll read them!)<br><br>December has been a pretty laidback month. I kinda just let the holiday season take over.

I, of course, spoiled myself with gifts. For Black Friday, I got myself a new 32" 4K TV for my room, a new set of Samsung earbuds, and a new Solid State Logic SSL2 Audio Interface.<br><br>Because it was the holiday season, voice acting kinda took a backseat. 

At the beginning of the month, I finished up recording live-action ADR for a nice role. 

I worked a little bit on Cats Love Water. Lots of giggling ensued. I really wish the best for that project.<br><br>The Kingdom Hearts Re:Dubbed crew got to do 2 practice sessions this month. I really hope to start recording for 358/2 Days Re:Dubbed soon. 

Out of the few auditions I did this month, there was one opportunity that I'm so excited about. I really hope I land it.<br><br>By the time the middle of December rolled around, the voice acting stuff was practically at a standstill for me. Nothing was going on for about 2 weeks. I get it. It's the holiday season. I churned out a couple of auditions, but it's nothing I'm holding my breath for.<br><br>The World Cup happened! I was rooting for Argentina the entire time! I was on the edge of my seat during the final match!

I focused my attention on gift-giving. I didn't stress too much about it this year. I gave my friends and family cool stuff I thought they would like.<br><br>My Christmas was okay. My parents and I made beef empanadas, which turned out delicious! My brother came over and that was it. It's never really that stressful with family. Maybe if my family were bigger, it would've been different.<br><br>I got
-A PlayStation Store gift card 
-A Hayao Miyazaki book
-A production sketch replica from Spirited Away of Chihiro in front of the bathhouse
-An animation cel from a Bugs Bunny cartoon, featuring the red monster Gossamer
-A sweater of Bugs and Gossamer, terrified of people.<br><br>I wrote a little bit for Children of the Sky Episode 6 this month. Just a couple of pages. Nothing crazy.  

I don't know what I want to do with all the scripts I'm writing. Have someone draw it? Draw it myself? But I don't have the money, time, or patience.<br><br>Yesterday, I recorded my singing and instead of deleting the file, I actually shared it. I thought about doing that all year, but every time I listened to my singing voice, I just hated it. I uploaded covers for "Unholy" and "Find Love" on my YouTube channel. I hope to do more.<br><br>Meanwhile, I'm getting really tired of working part-time at the theatre. I don't enjoy it anymore. The only reason I go is to get the money. That's it. I'm not that passionate. Maybe if I write a play about working at a theatre, I would be.<br><br>Sometimes I think about writing new things, but I always find myself stuck in the early brainstorming phases. I sometimes have trouble with the fundamental story stuff like character desires, resolutions, moving the story along, etc. Maybe I need a writing partner. Who knows?<br><br>I need to get a full-time job, mainly for the health benefits, because I'm a depressed diabetic who lives off of medication. And for some reason, it's the hardest thing to do. I've been wanting this for YEARS and I still haven't gotten it.<br><br>I was close to getting it once or twice this year, but afterward, I've been so disheartened. I'll try again next year. I don't know. 

I also need to drive. I hate driving. I just need to get more comfortable in a car. That way, I can feel a better sense of independence.<br><br>2022 had its ups and downs. 

I had a horrible falling out with a friend and I'm still trying to move on. There were days when I couldn't even get out of bed. I feel sick of my current job. Sometimes I feel that I don't even matter in the voice acting community.<br><br>But there were some good days. Even though I'm sick of it, I won a contest at my job. I get to make people enjoy their time at the theatre. I met some great voice actors in person at conventions. I went to Philadelphia by myself and met an online friend there.<br><br>I still remember the day Kingdom Hearts 4 was announced. I stayed up all night watching hype streams and then I got to go to a cherry blossom festival with my friends. We even saw Sonic 2 in theatres. 

Oh yeah, FFVII Rebirth was announced and I couldn't believe my eyes.<br><br>I technically went to 3 CONCERTS this year. Aurora was magical. Florence + The Machine was beautiful. Lady Gaga was absolutely euphoric. 

(Let me just say: Months later, I'm STILL on that Lady Gaga high. If she announced a new Vegas residency, I might be crazy enough to go.)<br><br>I don't like resolutions because I always think I'll fail them, but here are things that I want to do.
- Get a full-time job with medical benefits. 
- Drive more. 
- Write more. (Children of the Sky or maybe something new.)<br><br>- Voice act more. (If I get into an anime or a game, I would die.)
- Sing more. 
- Take more classes. 
- Connect with people more. 
- Just try to have fun.</p>
