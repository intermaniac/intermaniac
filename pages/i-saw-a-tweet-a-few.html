                      <p>I saw a tweet a few days ago about how ZOOL are the star, sun, (solar) eclipse and moon dynamic and I AM FREAKING OBSESS NOW!!!! This turn into a thread so SPOILERS ALERT DO NOT READ IT #Idolish7gamespoilers<br><br>Seriously Haruka as the star not only it's to symbolize zero, link to tenn, riku etc but also star represent guidance and protection and IT'S WHAT HE DOES IN P5!! #Idolish7gamespoilers He guides ToraMina to tell Toma about NO_MAD, guide Tamaki to found his dreams 1/16<br><br>#Idolish7gamespoilers protect ZOOL by telling Shiro to not hurt them, protecting Iori in a way by warning him about his attitude, if we believe that I7 are now the stars, telling Iori they gonna beat them in the next BORW is him saying to reach the stars, but also of 2/16<br><br>excellence, like how Takamasa said he is a good singer on paper but can't reach the fan in p3, a sign of excellence to me, but also how he is motivate to reach the height! 3/16<br><br>The sun for Torao make sense too, I already say it yesterday for my ZOOL flowers thread, but the sun represents luck, powerful and positive energy, which represents Torao well, he is powerful or at least appear to be, pretty positive and seems lucky in life, 4/16<br><br>it's also symbolize rebirth and life just like what zool is for him, it can also symbolize hope and optimism which represents Tora pretty well, he is bright like the sun and blazing like it too, confident and looks like living a peaceful life, sun also represents heroes 5/16<br><br>smth Torao is a huge fan of! <a href="https://t.co/38CKnfVTqv">https://t.co/38CKnfVTqv</a> here you can have few more negatives meaning too, like passing through your finger, like how all his wants are basically unreachable to him bc people telling him to not put the effort on it Or the "blazing sun mocking us" 6/16<br><br>This could represent how his life looks perfect, yet no one saw the real Torao, no one care about him for who he truly is, envy him but ignore his loneliness, the sun mocking him in a way, sun can also symbolize protection which he is and wealth pretty self explanatory here 7/16<br><br>Since the tweet I link Toma to solar eclipse bc of his fiery personality and his warmth link the sun, but eclipse bc can represent destruction, or at least the feeling of it, the dread of the world changing in a weird way, which is what Toma feel in antag quarter 8/16<br><br>as fans abandon him, as NO_MAD disband, but also solar eclipse are quick (few min) which could symbolize how he is the first one to try to move on from his trauma, <a href="https://t.co/54FOJToAis">https://t.co/54FOJToAis</a> here we have an extract where they associated the eclipse to the feeling of 9/16<br><br>isolation, what Toma felt, he was drowning alone (maybe a link to the moon who control the tide) <a href="https://t.co/jpp0iBuL8Y">https://t.co/jpp0iBuL8Y</a> they talk about how the solar eclipse take the monster out from the good guy which represents Toma in p3 well, he was an asshole but still very 10/16<br><br>a nice guy inside, heck eclipse came from Greek ekleipsis which mean "to abandon" which is literally Toma's story, being abandon by everyone! Solar eclipse could mean new beginning and twist of fate while Lunar mean sudden end which both go with Toma arc pretty well 11/16 <a href="https://t.co/DgifAjqtKW">https://t.co/DgifAjqtKW</a><br><br>And one last thing, eclipse only occurred when the Sun, the Moon and the Earth align and this is trg, with Gaku associated to the moon, Ryuu to the sun and Tenn to the Earth (yeah I know the irony), the three of them eclipsing Toma's 12/16<br><br>Ok now the moon, the moon is associated to feminity probably why Mina is the most androgynous of zool lol but also reflect the sun, and for this go with Nagi, who is also a sun type of character warmth, strong, powerful... with the two have a strong relationship 13/16<br><br>with Haruki, Mina chasing him in some way but he only saw the sun aka Nagi, the moon also represent moral instability and emotionality which is like Minami, even if he can control his emotion, he is pretty emotional person, probably the most, the way his wield is emotion 14/16<br><br>is the reasons he is such a good actor actually (*insert some kind of parallel with Riku*) the moon is also know to be stoic and mysterious, something most characters said about Mina, the moon can also be associate to evil which honestly Mina is the character I am the most 15/16<br><br>scare of hgkjdlshf lol but also can mean how one can survive alone but not live alone, showing Mina scare to let people but starving for close someone and I think that's all, it wasn't suppose to be that long of a thread but I had fun writing it lol hope you do too 16/16</p>
