                      <p>Okay so like, i really love eclipse lake as an episode but i feel like some weird opinions spawned from it??

and idk if these were wide spread opinions or i just saw a few of a smaller but vocal crowd, but anyway, small(maybe) thread!!ðŸ§µ<br><br>(not that he's often the one i see depicted as being the most antagonistic of the two) while amity is definitely annoyed with, and distrustful of him at this point, and rightfully so! but!! when we get to the part where it's just them and king at the dried up lake<br><br>things start to change, hunter hits his breaking point when he finds that there's no titan's blood. that also means that now that both of them know that there's no blood for them to get, they don't have to worry so much about the other swooping and stealing it from them<br><br>so there's less tension between them without that being an issue. this also gives amity a chance to see hunter's problems, and his need for the titan blood without him trying to keep up his emotional walls, bcuz he's just... too mentally exhausted at this point to keep them up<br><br>and now amity can see that, yeah, hunter was right, they do have a lot in common. because she recognizes, and understands that desperation to please, and be what people want you to be, and she knows the shame, and consequences that coming up short can have<br><br>that's what she had with her parents, and that's what she thinks she has with luz for a short while. she's terrified of losing luz, because she's the person that helped push her to stand up to her parents, and claim a fraction of the agency that she's been denied her entire life<br><br>similar to how hunter is afraid of losing what little approval belos gives him/losing belos through being replaced for failing again, bcuz while belos doesn't give hunter agency (belos is ready to hurt, or throw him out all together for doing as little as saying the wrong thing)<br><br>but he did give him a means to a future, and ways to succeed in the world in ways that he couldn't before (at least i imagine that's how hunter perceives it/was conditioned to perceive it) bcuz belos gave him magic, an important status, and a career, and with how integral magical<br><br>abilities are to the boiling isles (they're used for careers big and small, they're used in schools, they're used for everyday chores etc.) hunter didn't think he'd have a future, as he said in hunting palisman, whether that's true or not, that's how he sees it so in a way<br><br>luz, and belos gave amity, and hunter a means to a future they never thought possible before, they opened options for them. amity, and hunter are very alike in a lot of ways, and that's something that amity can see very clearly now. but she also sees, after king was able to<br><br>point out how she was reading the messages wrong, that luz was a positive influence on her life, while belos, regardless of how hunter views him, is a negative influence, she sees that the way belos influences him is very similar to how her own parents influenced her<br><br>she KNOWS how horrible that kind of disdain from a parental figure can be, and she also knows that she used to do whatever she could to avoid disappointing them, and she also knows how hard it is to break free from that kind of power that they held over her, and that belos holds<br><br>over hunter, especially without an outside eye to step in, and you that "hey, this isn't normal, or okay!" so she steps in to be that person, because she doesn't want another person to be stuck in that cycle. and i feel like past amity, before covention, could've gotten into<br><br>the same sort of situation, if she was in the same position as hunter before meeting luz, i feel like it's very likely she would've had a very similar course of action, and i feel like she knows that which is both part of why she helped him, and also why she WOULDN'T<br><br>be angry or hold it against him after this episode!! being a bit wary, maybe yeah, but hate him for it? absolutely not, because she knows he's absolutely able to change, &amp; more than anything, he's been forced to act the way he has been because of various circumstances in his life<br><br>. just like her. and even after he initiates an attack on her, all she says is "aw, being nice always works for luz!" like, she doesn't seem angry, and yes him threatening luz, could be another nail in the coffin for their relationship but also... i mean he kind of already has<br><br>threatened luz on multiple occasions so.. and also, i know that amity didn't suggest dissecting luz when she realized she wasn't a normal abomination but she was content to watch it happen, it's definitely not to the same extent but amity used to be very ruthless before getting<br><br>free of some of her parents expectations for her she understands what hunter's going through to a pretty great extent, so acting like she'd hate hunter, and think of him as... unworthy of her other friends' love, and care is a very weird, and kind of unfair take? and i don't<br><br>think that hunter's personality is the kind that she'd have like... a strong issue with, like he's got a lot of similarities to a lot of the hexsquad i don't think it'd make sense for her to just be like, 'ugh i really don't vibe with him' either.
ANYWAY i'm not sure this is all<br><br>totally coherent or not, but anyway, those are a lot of my thoughts on the matter. i know i said i was gonna adress a couple other points but uh this is already really long, so i'll make separate threads for those, i'm sorry this is so long ðŸ˜­<br><br>@clovariia can end the series without them interacting right?</p>
