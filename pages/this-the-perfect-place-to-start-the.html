                      <p>1. this the perfect place to start a thread on the sheer duality of the indian judiciary , i cannot call it as hypocrisy because it crosses that threshold by a lightyear. but this entire episode is blessing in disguise. this is my personal opinion.
https://t.co/nxspgsnlbn<br><br>2. for the first time in my life, that's a bold claim. ok let's go with this atleast for the first time since i began to fill theses types of issues we are presented with an situation where two individuals from opposite spectrum r facing law with similar cases attached to them.<br><br>3. on one hand you have #nupursharma who is a hindu and on the other hand you hand you have jumbair sorry  who is a muslim. so two people from two different religions and ideologies but in court under similar sections, yes there is a world of difference between both of them, but<br><br>4. for argument sake let's look at the from the lens of the laws that they have alleged to have broken. we never got this kind of a opportunity to see how the melodramatics treat people when they belong to a particular religion and ideology. this a opportunity to test the bias...<br><br>5. of our melodramatics and looks like we have an answer. present and crystal clear than ever before. this tweet below exactly expressed my thoughts. this is a clear cut case of how the melodramatics interpret and use the same law to different people based on their own biases... https://t.co/uwjgmqbghr<br><br>6. remember the nupur july 1 hearing where she was blamed for all the things happening in the world and now look in the case of jumbair suddenly they were worried about foe, dissent, individual liberty and baboons back...etc.<br><br>7. look at our home boi dyc say some pretty nice things about jumbair, pretty well knowing, what he did, what he does for a living and how he manipulates information into fake news.  he is worried that jumbair is being harassed. https://t.co/beoqwomp2k<br><br>8. again dyc saying that they cannot stop jumbair from tweeting, again insert what the melodramatics said on july 1 in nupur case. so much equality shown here by melodramatics that i wish i could kiss them &amp; their parents for giving them to us. https://t.co/wcywxzppbc<br><br>8. from this act alone we can clearly establish the double standards that the indian judiciary has for its citizens. so what now you religion, your caste and you associations decide if you get a day in court and these factors will will decide how the courts treat you and.....<br><br>9. if you would be found guilty or not irrespective to the facts of the case and evidence. let me give you two examples of how the melodramatics treat you depending on what you are....<br><br>example 1. jumbair https://t.co/cz1lldlooa<br><br>example 2. a common citizen https://t.co/jmweolpbok<br><br>10. this is neither the first nor won't be the last. these are the cards we are dealing with. what the below pic says is true. but i have a feeling that what the melodramatics are doing are with malice because even a stupid person is right once but my melodramatics are not.... https://t.co/hrscvntnht<br><br>11. indeed the sc has released someone who is bound to do more damage now with impunity. if july 1 comments by meloads was one thing this release today takes it to a whole new level. look at how hurried dyc was to get jumbair out. he did not want to waste a single second.... https://t.co/jx5cysf68a<br><br>12. and now that jumbair is out melodramatics will sleep happily whether same melodramatics endangered the lives of nupur sharma and family and along with here untold number of hindus. is this enough to ask for reforms of this clearly biased institution.<br><br>this institution needs reforms as soon as possible, they are hell bent on destroy is and our culture, they are acting with malicious intent and impunity. at every opportunity they get  they are using it to destroy our culture and our identity. we are being treated as untouchables https://t.co/qah6tvelpu<br><br>14. everyone has to wake up from their slumber f the group right atleast fight for your own rights to live, i am not asking you to join the band and fight for everyones rights, of this continues you will not have any rights to exercise.<br><br>15. all i asking you is start asking questions to your elected reps, ask them why the mel's are not answering our cry, ask why you are being treated as a rat in your own home, ask why they have so much power, ask why they are untouched, ask why should they be give special powers.<br><br>16. start now , this may should very dramatic maybe it is. but i rather me asking questions now getting answers and accountability and reforms now than not be alive later, write to your reps asking about judiciary reforms today. get a group of friends to do the same.......smh<br><br>credits: @shivaroor @indiatoday @smitadeshmukh @kushal_mehra @barandbench @livelawindia @kakar_harsha @iyervval @rashmidvs</p>
