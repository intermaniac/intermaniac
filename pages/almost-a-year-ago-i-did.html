                      </ul>
                      <p>1[Thread]Almost a year ago I did a announcement trailer for a comic story I was gonna write and draw called Azure Dawn that I was learning art for because I couldn't get an artist for the style I wanted easily and so was gonna do it myself and give it out for free. What happened? <a href="https://t.co/kOR9wUX3E3">https://t.co/kOR9wUX3E3</a><br><br>[2] Well as soon as I had committed to releasing the trailer and working on the project, I had agreed to take a year off of my novel to focus on art so I could do the best I could. Learned how to script comics better, learned a whole lot, and right around the time I made-<br><br>[3] the trailer, I got wrapped up in Fulfillment for Peregrine, my Dad's heart issue devolved into a variety of problems requiring surgery. I still did what I could to study art and get better, but serious production really didn't happen. I have the first 5pages roughed, and am- <a href="https://t.co/XP3kqjtyeh">https://t.co/XP3kqjtyeh</a><br><br>[4] happy with them. But the script has gone through 7 revisions with changes of story, changes of flow, changes of scope. Basically normal stuff that happens. When working on a project yourself. New designs, new characters, etc. I'm in a good place now with regards to the arc.<br><br>[5] However it is a passion project I'm doing for free, and so it gets done when it get's done. I've done some art featuring the characters and posted to discords of my main cast and they've definitely come along. My art has come along way after dedicating myself for 1yr. New vs. <a href="https://t.co/4a6AdO097a">https://t.co/4a6AdO097a</a><br><br>[6] I post art I do at work to kill time in the Graded Discord and to other discords and while my poses are getting better, my anatomy is getting better, and now I'm putting more emphasis on expressions, and vehicles with perspective. So work is still underway, I assure you. <a href="https://t.co/tE3Jd9tNor">https://t.co/tE3Jd9tNor</a><br><br>[7] So why am I posting this thread which is ultimately self serving? tbh, with the 1yr anniversary of the project trailer saying publication would begin in 2022, I kind of felt a pang that said I should at least say something about it. It's still something I'm passionate about.<br><br>[8] There has just been other things that I needed to focus on that take a higher priority. Peregrine Fulfillment is nearing completion with only a small number of domestics just waiting to ship and internationals which arrangements have been made for. Running the twitch and yt-<br><br>[9] channels to let people know we are still here and didn't vanish into the night. I have the novel I put off for a year waiting for someone to stop being sad boy hours and be my editor, which never happened so I'm moving on there. I'm also writing my dad's unfinished novel.<br><br>[10] Time management is a notorious obstacle to me, but we're getting there. Also my day job, trying to get that higher level position at the day job, always important. But I keep Azure Dawn close to my heart, and I work on it in small ways when I can as time permits.<br><br>[11] Currently during its newly revised form, it is probably the best version of the story and the characters to date. But it does depend on the fact that I'm doing all the work myself and am not striving for professional level art, which is why I was gonna give it away.<br><br>[12] The complete story arc of the adventure is unfinished. I know how I want it to end, just haven't made time to plot it out properly and go over it with the editor for it. But I think though a good goal for next year, is by the end of 2023, I want the first 2 chapters ready.<br><br>[13] It's by no means the story I NEED to tell, it's a Story I WANT to tell, and I think the world needs more stories like this. It has it's clich√©'s, uses it's tropes, but that doesn't matter. It's not the ingredients, it's how you use them that matters in the end.<br><br>[14] So I hope that when it's ready, you'll all come and meet the wonderful characters I dreamt up for a project I decided upon one day almost on a lark, but that became so much more to me. In a way it's become like a piece of me.<br><br>[Final] So I hope until then people will continue to wait patiently, for a new world awaits to be revealed. A world of Airships, Sky Pirates, Aerial fleet battles, floating islands, and Adventures just waiting for you to take the first step.

Fly Safe Everyone.
