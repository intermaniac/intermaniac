                      <p>Journey into Code - MONTH 2 (ðŸ§µ)

And we're back!

Last month I started to level up my tech skills by learning the basics of Python and JS, and built a #Bitcoin website that implements both.

This time I felt confident enough to venture into #Rust !

Here's how it went down:

1/ <a href="https://t.co/bCEZinlLcD">https://t.co/bCEZinlLcD</a><br><br>First off, I wanted to improve my #Git a little. This website that represents its dynamics in a graph and, me being a ultra-visual learner, I found it extremely useful. 

<a href="https://t.co/wHXIMTxZ0H">https://t.co/wHXIMTxZ0H</a>

(I had to use other sources too, but this did most of the heavy lifting)

2/<br><br>Then I moved on to #Rust

Rust is a difficult language with restrictive memory &amp; type safety; it's becoming increasingly relevant in the BTC ecosystem, but I had a bad experience with it last year when, encouraged by @giacomozucco, I tried to learn it as my 1st language (ðŸ¥²)

3/<br><br>After reading the first chapters of the Rust Book I quitted code in general for 1 year.

(In Giacomo's defense, he tries to convince literally everyone to learn it: when Milo was born, my 1st question was 

"how's Milo?" 

&amp; my 2nd one 

"is he studying Rust already?"

ðŸ˜‚)

4/<br><br>This time I had become accostumed to code notation, but I still had a bad feeling about the book, so I took a slightly different path.

Instead of starting from what it has in common with other languages, I started from what makes it different...

5/<br><br>...the memory management, the expressive type system, etc.

These concepts are usually taught later on, but I studied them on various sources *before* going through the Book.

I found it way easier this way because, for example, it makes you understand clearly why...

6/<br><br>...Rust annotation includes things like the bytesize of integers.

As usual, while studying theory I also practiced w/ the language. For example, I built this small script with 4 cellular automata, each with a different probabilistic rewriting system 

(bluebird OP plz nerf) 

7/ <a href="https://t.co/LwMbLVJM6Y">https://t.co/LwMbLVJM6Y</a><br><br>As I kept working with #Rust , I realized it has so many restrictions, that it doesn't feel like you're writing the code by yourself. It's like you &amp; the compiler are writing it together. Like high-level languages were a way to project our ideas unidirectionally into code...

8/<br><br>...while Rust is more like a back &amp; forth. You have to express ideas in a way the machine can understand better, and get less bugs in exchange .

I'm not saying the Rust language has a conscious mind, but using it *feels* like coding in sync with an artificial unconscious.

9/<br><br>(Which is funny because #Lacan used to say that "the unconscious is structured like a language" lol)

I also started delving deeper into Bitcoin. I always had a decent big-picture vision of it, but I needed to zoom in and start understanding the technical details.

10/<br><br>@in3rsha 's block explorer on <a href="https://t.co/6SJqOBWKuq">https://t.co/6SJqOBWKuq</a> was extremely helpful to (literally) zoom in on the blockchain lol.

(again, I really am a visual learner) 

S/o to @giacomozucco for suggesting it to me, he's not always the bad guy in this story ðŸ˜‚

11/<br><br>I'm using many Bitcoin resources, but as usual I'm only gonna mention the ones that impressed me.

@renepickhardt had this great video about transactions: <a href="https://t.co/gmyNSrOJ0k">https://t.co/gmyNSrOJ0k</a>

I also started playing around with Script, the programming language of BTC smart contracts.

12/<br><br>@kallewoof 's Bitcoin debugger was really useful: <a href="https://t.co/xAqiGGxwbR">https://t.co/xAqiGGxwbR</a>

Script is a stack-based, non-Turing-complete language. I realized it would be relatively easy to implement a simple stack-based language, so I chose to try writing one in Rust as a form of practice.

13/<br><br>I decided to implement the interpreter in Rust-WebAssembly, to use the browser as a front-end.

But I also wanted it to be Turing-complete, and to implement common control flow like loops. 

I quickly learned these two things are in contrast with each other: browsers...

14/<br><br>...usually work single-threadedly, and run an event loop that includes tasks with a limited time allocation.

Basically the browser doesn't want you to launch an infinite loop, because it would lose control over the thread of operations.

15/<br><br>It's still easy to run a Javascript loop in the browser; but WebAssembly is a different matter.

Even the official Rust playground doesn't support loops, as you can see.

I took this as an opportunity to tackle a slightly more difficult technical problem.

After a little...

16/ <a href="https://t.co/byeilJg08d">https://t.co/byeilJg08d</a><br><br>...research, and a lot of tinkering, I found a way to implement a stack-based, Turing complete interpreter in Rust-Wasm, w/o access to Rust native loop&amp;while keywords.

Basically the Rust code runs an algorithm every millisecond, and then gives back  control to the browser.

17/ <a href="https://t.co/YBMHPeA0ih">https://t.co/YBMHPeA0ih</a><br><br>I had to include everything in this algorithm: that "Run" button doesn't actually launch the interpreter function, it just change its own title. The interpreter's algorithm checks (among other things) the title of the button, and simulates a normal GUI behavior based on it. 

18/ <a href="https://t.co/pSrnA81tTs">https://t.co/pSrnA81tTs</a><br><br>It was an interesting learning experience. Maybe I'll expand this project in the next months.

Btw, here's the #Bitcoin website I made last month, it has a custom domain now! 

<a href="https://t.co/XHXzniLfU3">https://t.co/XHXzniLfU3</a>

(that domain costed me like, 5$, we're unbelievably early)

19/<br><br>That's it for this month.

I'm trying to improve my tech skill in order to find a job in this bear market. If you have any suggestion or proposals, my DMs are open!

Please RT if you liked the thread! See you in one month ðŸ‘‹
