The Eclipse series is really a good way to open our lenses regarding social issues. And how the series was able to depict them— equality, human rights, democracy; as well as the horrors of an authoritarian society and its consequences<br><br>Personally, it was a rollercoaster ride. As I start watching the series (episode 01), I tend to compare it with Not Me (OffGun), since they were almost similar— but I was became a victim of a traitor plot; because it is not the same<br><br>Full of emotions, and aside from the romance, the drama, and the dynamics of the students, they were able to represent types of people in the society— just what Neo have said during the special episode, “it sums up the society, and narrow it in school” (non-verbatim)<br><br>There were a lot of characters—
Students in common, but have different beliefs. I just don’t want to discuss them all here since there maybe some planned watchers that I might spoil. So I won’t mention any names.<br><br>There is “The Blind Follower” that wants to be part of the rotting system, but did not had the opportunity to be a part of. And instead, this person practiced what the rotting system is doing— without any chances of understanding it and how it can affect other people—<br><br>“The Neutralites” which needs a lot of guidance to understand the belief completely. These are the people that usually called as the neutrals since they can side either bases. However, people cannot cross two rivers at once. These people should think and ask guides if needed<br><br>“The Observers” are the ones that function as audiences in the act— people who express their thoughts if something is good or bad. They are crucial to identify problematic parts in the society. And it is the job of the higher-ups to listen carefully.<br><br>“The Seekers” are the people who wants to achieve the authenticity of the system; how rot it is? How ruthless it is to other people? And they will do anything to discover everything— to explore the truth within covers and expose the system to everyone.<br><br>“The Concealers” are the people who wants to protect the system— to keep everything from falling apart. To not let go of the things even if it pains them— even if it tries to affect their entirety. No matter what happens, they will cover everything— even if it cost them to rot<br><br>“The Conservatives” are the people who stand against the modern changes and beliefs. Who stand against the tide of the times and skeptical to the things they believed as helpful to them. These are the people that does not listen to whims— and a tough nut to crack<br><br>“The Keepers” are the people who knows everything but decided not to tell other people because they afraid it may complicate things. They know how the system rots, and what are its consequences— but they stayed silent. Unless someone can make them speak.<br><br>“The Awake” are the people who knew that the system is already rotting— that the system is bad, and the system affects people. They are the people who have the most roles and can move across other types— they know because they knew.<br><br>“The Victims” are the people who rot because of the system. They are the ones that are being targeted and suppressed. People around them are affected, and their health become also affected— and it affects them in so many ways.<br><br>This series is highly recommended most especially if you want to try a different side of Boys Love (BL) series. Every episodes are thrilling and it can help us understand people.<br><br>Stream also “Not Me” since these two series almost has the same genre, but different setting. So up to you if what are you going to watch first.<br><br>However if you are a fan of Khaotung (from 2gether, Tonhon Chonlatee, Tale of Thousand Stars), First (from Not Me), Neo (from Cause You’re My Boy, Tonhon Chonlatee, Fish Upon the Sky) and Louis (Fish Upon the Sky), you will love this series 🫶🏼<br><br>- End of Thread -</p>
