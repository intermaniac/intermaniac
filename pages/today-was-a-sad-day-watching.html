I'm tagging Mojang workers from Java Edition, feature designers, programmers, PR etc.

@_LadyAgnes @_Ulraf_ @kingbdogz @Xilefian @jeb_ @Mega_Spud @slicedlime @Cojomax99 

I'm missing many of you but it's fine if 1 of you reads the üßµ<br><br>I really think, you, the developers, workers and the voice of the upcoming features on social media have no fault on this lack of content on the new updates.

I wish you the best and I hope you can change the path Minecraft is heading to.<br><br>Since 1.16 I've not feel a polished version.

If the current team cannot deliver a big update, Microsoft could hire and expand teams to deliver bigger and better ingame content.

I cannot trust anymore the messages Mojang sends to us on the YouTube, Twitter or Discord.<br><br>This was part of today's show:

"I will take some time to talk about what we learnt from previous years, because we have announced some features that we didn't manage to deliver and it's important that we learn from that and that we take ACTION from that."<br><br>This didn't happen yet, words don't have value yet. 

What we know so far is that Mojang preffers to be silent and not share anything to avoid any posible controversy.

When we have the 1.20 in our hands we will see if this was true or not and we will see if it's a good update.<br><br>A better way to announce this could've been:

We're not ready to share 1.20 with you yet... but... we have a surprise!

A new snapshot/beta is AVAILABLE NOW, with the first update of the upcoming content!

Let's check this trailer! or Let's check this with Agnes, Ulraf...!<br><br>Kingbdogz said this about adding 3 mobs on an update:

"it might be possible but there wouldn't be much time for anything else in the update"

<a href="https://t.co/6UsqLBKZD9">https://t.co/6UsqLBKZD9</a>

That means is not feasible to add 3 new mobs and have a theme around an update?<br><br>Then... what about this?

1.14: Wandering Trader, Fox, Panda, Pillager, Ravager
1.14: Added a whole theme about villagers.

1.16: Piglin, Brute Piglin, Hoglin, Zoglin, Strider.
1.16: Added A LOT of content.

1.17: Goat, Glow Squid, Axolotl.
1.17: Added many items/blocks/ores.<br><br>Mob vote generates a lot of toxicity on social media, I know it's good for the biz. I'm sure this past week has been a spike on MC stats but... what if Mojang prepares a cool update and instead of voting you tease us with 4-5 videos a whole week before announcing the update?<br><br>Keeping the secrets and having some hints on the teasers would make people talk about it.

This could be done with mobs, blocks, items even gameplay mechanics!

It could generate a lot of attention/attraction without the toxicity and competition around the mob/biome vote.<br><br>Or just surprise us, and add all of the mobs!

I really mean it, is NOT impossible, I won't compare you to modders but you need to see that you've done it in the past!

Me and my whole community of singleplayer vanilla fans have felt sadness and dissapointment today.<br><br>I'm trying my best to not be harsh, I love chatting and hanging with Ulraf, or tweeting and interacting with all of you the devs/pr.

I like what you guys have done in the past. I've even played with some of you! You're great! But the announcements and past versions are not.<br><br>And I'm sure many of you can empathyze with us, as I'm doing with you. I'm sure you can understand why we're not happy.

It's not about not naming the update, or showing only 5 small features. I understand what you're doing.

It's about everything else.<br><br>Things need to change if you want the hardcore fans to be happy.

Other SMALLER studios release bigger and greater content in huge updates.

I understand late game is not a priority, I understand a new dimension is not a priority, I understand an End rework is not a priority.<br><br>I understand you have your own pipeline of upcoming features and only you know what is urgent and what is not.

But I also understand that what you just showed us could be a 1.15 like update this december. And you guys could be working on a bigger project for the 1.21.<br><br>Releasing 2 GOOD versions per year is not impossible.

I understand programming the back end of Minecraft is a nightmare, but with the right team everything is possible.

I understand how slow is the process to add 1 mob to Minecraft, once again, a bigger team makes the dream!<br><br>I've been reading comments from @ilmango1 , @cubfan135 @SimplySarc... and they're completely right.

I hope Mojang takes action. I understand we're not the target of your announcements and I understand we're a small % of the playerbase.

But we're still Minecraft fans.<br><br>Just to be sure Minecraft problems are clear...

‚ûùDoes the Elder guardian have a placeholder drop?
‚ûùWill the fletching table have an use?
‚ûùCan fireflies just co-exist with frogs?
‚ûùMore uses for copper and amethyst!
‚ûùMineshaft generation room.
‚ûùCan we get renewable sand?<br><br>More examples of what's wrong:

Inventory, lack of performance on JE, general progression &amp; endgame, villagers being too op since 1.14, 2 years missing from the last combat update version, where's archeology?, caves are empty!, thousands of bugs in Mojira.

We need a QoL update.<br><br>And this is the thread about the current situation of Minecraft's development. 

Mob votes are toxic.
Recent announcements underwhelming.
Many parts of Minecraft are missing content.
Excuses don't work anymore.

Minecraft is the most sold game ever.

C'mon @Mojang @Microsoft.<br><br>P.S:

For the people tagged, please, don't take this as an attack. I admire you, I love you. I understand you might not have the power to change anything.

For everyone, sorry if there's too many grammar mistakes, I've rushed this thread. It's been a long day.

Peace! üñ§ü´°üíÄüñ§</p>
