                      <p>As an ECS on Fargate fan, I got a lot of questions about the recent incident / outage.

Let's talk about it... 🧵 1/43 

TL;DR: meh. Incidents happen and this one did not teach us anything new about building on AWS. I expect more profound drama during these roaring 20s!<br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 0: everything always fails and AWS is bad at communication!

🤷

Addendum: you can build a 99.9999% available service for 100 million or you can build a service that fails like... 3 days a year for 1 million. Business will often chose the latter and that's ok!<br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 1: have good observability in place!

If your systems were impacted, did you notice the errors before AWS declared an incident? Did you understand them?

Genuinely the impact might've been too small to trigger anything, so it's ok if you did not notice it!<br><br>Potential indicator: 📈SLIs/SLOs for response times

If you were running at say 90% capacity, then response times and latency should go up, no?

Again, these might'n've triggered and that's ok! It depends on your scale — for example, only 1 of my clients had an SLI alert.<br><br>Potential indicator:📈ECS/EKS events

For everything regarding your cluster an event is emitted: ECS can natively send events to EventBridge and for EKS you can parse the logs or use a third party tool.

This is quite an in-depth implementation tho — usually not worth it.<br><br>Potential indicator: 📈Number of actual running containers versus number of desired running containers

This is debatably the easiest and most common metric. Depending on your scale, it might'n've been triggered tho!

Some clients had this trigger, some did not.<br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 2: when AWS declares an incident, you should declare an incident too!

It's fine if you missed the sporadic initial errors, but once AWS declared an incident your on-call had to be alerted!

ALL my clients got altered and you should've had this too!<br><br>Yes, it may be a noisy alert at times, but it's worth it — this also creates a really nice culture of "oh, everything DOES fail all the time".

These events are served on a "best effort" basis, so also subscribe to RSS and Twitter feeds:  <a href="https://t.co/oZNX1SL89Q">https://t.co/oZNX1SL89Q</a><br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 3: when there's an incident, know what matters for your company!

AWS made it clear that only new containers are affected and proposed mitigations:
  1) migrate from Fargate to EC2 if you can (hard, but cheap)
  2) stop scaling down (easy, but expensive)<br><br>At 15:30 the incident was official and it was made clear that *only new* containers are affected. 

At 20:46 AWS explicitly said we should disable scaling down for Fargate containers since running containers are fine.

Only 30 minutes later were new launches disabled!<br><br>⏲️ your company cares more about staying up that money?

The second the incident started or, at worst, when AWS explicitly said it, you should've scaled up to a sane maximum.

Usually scaling up and down between 30 and 50 containers? Forced static 75 containers, scaling disabled!<br><br>This is what most folks did and it made this incident a non-event. 

"Oh, only new containers are affected. Meh, let's make sure we have no new containers for a while"

This is what most of my customers did. It took a while for all containers to successfully start though.<br><br>If your on-call engineers did not feel comfortable making this tradeoff OR if your engineers did not know what your company prioritizes between money and staying up...  you have a problem!

Seriously, look into this! ⚠️<br><br>💸 Does your company care more about money that staying up?

That's a valid option too! Gracefully fail your apps, enable some downtime mode, do whatever you plan is in these cases. You do have a plan, right?

In my case, some customers just disabled a couple non-vital workflows.<br><br>The "switch workers from Fargate to EC2" line was interesting and unexpected.

For EKS clusters with both Fargate and EC2 workers this switch was trivial, if your code could handle it. Definitely something to architect for!

For anything else... I'd say it's over-engineering.<br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 4: you need operational feature flags!

Again, everything fails all the time, so make sure you can handle failure gracefully.

Operational feature flags are lifesaving in moments like these.<br><br>↕️ "We only have 30% of our desired capacity, flip the switch so we don't do that complex processing anymore. This way we can handle all the traffic with 30%"

↕️ "Service X is barely working due to the incident, let's disable that for now but we'll let the rest of the app work"<br><br>↕️ "Oops, scaling is broken. Let's disable aggressive scaling and let's reuse workers since we don't know how easily new workers will come up"

These depend a lot on what your company is doing and on how your services are architected, but there are always options!<br><br>🧑‍🏫 Lesson number 5: only one production AWS account is not ideal!

When things recovered, they went on a per-AWS-account basis. If you had multiple AWS accounts, some accounts recovered way faster that others. If you only had 1 AWS account that was at the end of the line...<br><br>I think that's all the lessons from this incident, but I am biased on this since I've been doing cloud for a while now 🤔 

Do you have any other learnings from this incident? Anything unexpected happen? Did your experience not match the one I had?
If so, please reply to this!<br><br>In conclusion, meh.

If you've been doing cloud for a while, this was a "heh, Fargate got it's first big incident and it's not what I expected"

If you're newer to cloud, congrats! You got to learn 🎉
