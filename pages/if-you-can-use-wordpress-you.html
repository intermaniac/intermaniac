                      <p>If you can use Wordpress, you can earn as much as N200,000 monthly if you understand what I am about to share with you now.

#Thread<br><br>I know it's that of the year when your brain racks for so many ideas to hammer with before the end of the year.

You probably have set a goal to make as much as N20million this year alone, apparently, you're yet to break it down on how you wish to generate this income...<br><br>...but your spirit is high and you must hammer this year.

Now, let me assure you this, It i possible! But you must know exactly what you're doing.

So, let's break this down. In my database, I've trained over 1000 people in Website Design and Digital Marketing since 2011...<br><br>...and I know one major challenge that they all faced before I went further to help them understand the process.

Web Solution Business is still like the Oil Well of our Economy. The Industry is not saturated, as a matter of fact, we do not have enough experts in the industry.<br><br>Major one is being a do all man. 

Bisect now for easy conversion.
One of the easiest ways to generate as much as N200,000 monthly income through Web Design Business is to go with the strategy of Subscription.<br><br>This is it, you have a good Web Solution Skill, with this, I mean, you can create Websites, Funnels, etc.
90% of the people with this skills speak the same language. They are mostly selfish, so go the reverse way.<br><br>In Nigeria, you're most going to be offering your services to the the MSMEs and SMEs as reported by Statista, that we have over 45million of them in Nigeria right now, and of course, they need your solution, although, may not be able to afford your fees.<br><br>They know what will help them grow, but the tag, Small Business also means that, their budget is small.
So, Design a Subscription based System, outline your services in the subscription (This can be as simple as a Google Form), or Membership page.<br><br>Instead of charging N200,000 one time fee for your service, break it into 12 months and and charge just N16,700 monthly.

With this, you will have easy conversion and may also convert as much as 15 - 20 clients, depending on your commitment.<br><br>15 clients paying just N16,700 monthly will give you N250,000 in a month, and you can always exceed the number monthly, but make sure you deliver your promised values, that's the one way to keep them renewing monthly.

Understand why most websites don't get renewed and handle it.<br><br>They are not interested in your skills, their major concern is the solution they will get from you. Don't bother about how long you've been designing a website.

"What can your website design skill do for the growth of my business"? That's one question you must answer them.<br><br>Beyond your website design skill, there are several solutions, businesses need, that you can define and offer them the solution. 

Stop projecting as a website designer, no one cares.

Primary interest is Digital Visibility and representative.<br><br>"Can your Web Design skill, help me automate my  business process, as I have less number of staff"?

Learn to get them answers to their unasked question, even before they ask.

The next question will always be, what will it cost? With your subscription system, they will afford it<br><br>Take your website design skill, as a business; have a marketing budget yourself and show up daily with the analyzed solution.

Create visually appealing carousel designs, analyzing your solution daily.

And make sure you gain the most important asset (Data), from your prospects.<br><br>Finally, if you do not intend to go look for a job (as an employee), learn marketing as well.

Learn how to market your skills. Understanding the business of your skills, is more important than your skills.
