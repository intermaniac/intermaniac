                      <p>What does it take to be a full-time content creator on YouTube?

Well for most ppl a decent 6-12 min video takes 4-10 hours to edit.

Optimizing thumbnails, titles and upload data 1-2 hours.

Research and scripting 2-6 hours.

And you’d need to upload 1-3x a week. (Thread)<br><br>On an average if a creator is making high value (attention getting, interest driven), high quality (well produced and well performed) content, consistently (1-3 videos a week, ever week), and they do this for 3-5 years, they COULD get to a position to go full-time.<br><br>However if we use those factors as a baseline:

A creator needs 15-25 hours a week of time freedom.

And 3-5 years of a stable income and stable lifestyle that allows them to create.

And to be competitive they need at least mid level hardware and software on top of it.<br><br>So to go FullTime a creator needs 15-25 hours minimum to invest in content for 1-3 uploads per week.

They likely need $3000-$5000 worth of capital to get to make competitive production value content between cameras, lights, microphones and a computer to edit with and software.<br><br>None of this includes the first 500 hours of study to be capable, competent and competitive.

100 hrs video editing practice.

100 hrs learning content strategy.

100 hrs l learning YouTube’s systems &amp; tools.

100 hrs of graphic design. 

100 hrs learning lights, camera, audio<br><br>Without investing those 500 hours people typically end up making very low quality, below average or mediocre content.

Content with no plan or purpose that is random and self serving and unattractive to viewers.

Lazy thumbnails.

And overall unemployable to watch videos.<br><br>The description above is the overall majority of videos uploaded to YouTube…

However the average creator doesn’t upload 100 consistent videos for 1 audience in 1-2 years.

If they did they would have 500-1000 hours of education if they were intentional about it.<br><br>If a creator uploads their first “100 crappy videos” with the intent to get 1% better each upload and they put at least 10 hours round trip into each video and upload 1-2 videos a week without missing a week…

They can meet the threshold for learning to make DECENT content.<br><br>If this takes them 1-2 years that is them graduating from being a candidate to being an actual apprentice level YouTuber.

If they go from there and make better quality video and learn to edit faster and find their voice and niche they can get to their first 10,000 subscribers.<br><br>After 3 years of making DECENT videos consistently while still improving to the threshold of competitive quality instead of just acceptable quality, meaning a video from a channel with 100K-1M subscribers, is indistinguishable from their content. A creator might go FullTime.<br><br>By full-time we mean having the option to replace traditional income with Creator income, usually diversified by some combination of:

Ad Revenue 
Fan Funding
Selling Products 
Affiliate Links
Sponsored Content 

FullTime income is typically $35,000-$60,000 USD.<br><br>Why am I not saying how many views and subscribers it takes to go full-time.

It’s correlation instead of cause and it depends on your niche. But also your lifestyle.

If you’re a gamer you need 2-5 million views a month. 

Real estate agent? 250K views.

Earns $3K-$5K/mo<br><br>But that assumes content is monetized and also it makes you dependent on the platform entirely.

To have stability you need more income streams and a reliable MRR (monthly recurring revenue) that can at least cover living expenses and healthcare coverage.<br><br>Most creators path to going FullTime is being able to get a monthly sponsor with a long term contract 6-12 months that would be close to their monthly paycheck. 

For those who can’t get those deal they try increase product sales or affiliate links to tie their money less to time<br><br>Making FullTime YouTube sustainable largely comes down. To passive/automated income such as e-commerce and affiliate links, and monthly recurring revenue from long term brand deals and paid memberships.

This ties income to value instead of labor/time for the creator.<br><br>Beyond making $80,000 a year the best investment a creator could make is instead of increasing lifestyle, hiring a full-time editor to help them make 25- 100 videos a year that can be the BEST videos in their niche or category.

This is better than a second channel initially.<br><br>The next best investment is building their own site or e-commerce store that they can use to generate $35,000-$50,000 a year of reliable income that they control fully, that will cover their lifestyle independent of social media that could rely on ads for traffic.<br><br>Details of individual content format, niches, circumstances or preferences aside this is what it would take to be a full-time content creator.<br><br>@AlexArmitage_ The key to the speed lies in PREPARATION.

If you build a dedicated top down table and have a cart full of proper and paper for flat lays easy for product stuff.
