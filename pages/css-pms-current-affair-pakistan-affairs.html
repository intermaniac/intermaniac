Pakistan’s Foreign Policy: Seven Strategic Dimensions

In this thread, I am going to discuss the contents and contours of Pakistan's foreign policy with particular reference to its neighbours, global powers, and Saudi Arabia.<br><br>What should be Pakistan's policy towards Iran?

Iran is an uncomfortable neighbour which can create trouble for Pakistan and has been doing so but there is no alternative to strategic restraint. Let us engage Iran as far as possible but be ready for any eventuality<br><br>6. Afghanistan- The Mythical Strategic Depth

With few periods of uneasy peace, Pakistan-Afghanistan relations have always been acrimonious during the last seven decades more due to Afghanistan's machinations than those of Pakistan.<br><br>Afghanistan refused to accept the newly formed weak Pakistan and instead laid claim on half of Pakistan. In  1951 Afghan terrorist Said Akbar who is celebrated in Afghanistan, assassinated Pakistan's PM Liaquat Ali Khan. Throughout 1950s there were off and on Afghan incursions.<br><br>It was Pashtun General Ayyub's ascent to power in the 1960s which helped in restraining Afghanistan to some extent. However, soon after Pakistan's defeat in 1971, Afghanistan again started its old policy forcing Pakistan to successfully implement its Forward Policy.<br><br>"Before 1975, ISI did not conduct any operation in Afghanistan; it was only after decades of Republic of Afghanistan's proxy war against Pakistan, support to militants and armed incursion, particularly in the early 1970s, that Pakistan was forced to retaliate"-Tomsen, Peter 2013<br><br>1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan added another destabilising factor in Pakistan-Afghanistan relations. Besides the influx of millions of Afghan refugees, thousands of Afghan jihadis got training in Pakistan to fight against Soviet forces forcing them to leave Afghanistan<br><br>Since then Pakistan has been involved with Afghanistan's internal affairs, to some extent by design and to some extent by default. There is too much at stake for Pakistan in terms of its external security and internal stability in what happens inside Afghanistan.<br><br>However, blaming Pakistan for securing Strategic Depth as Pakistan’s policy towards Afghanistan is a myth. This concept was borrowed from WW2 when the French Resistance, having lost critical space within France took refuge in the UK, and continued war-fighting<br><br>As General Tariq rightly argues that it is Pakistan that has provided strategic depth to Afghanistan by providing bases to resistance forces against the Soviets, accommodating millions of Refugees,  providing roads/ports for trade<br><br>Yes, there is strategic depth in the political sense which implies Pakistan’s desperate need to have a stable, neutral even if not friendly Afghanistan to avoid fighting a two-front war i.e., with India on its eastern border and with Afghanistan on its western border.<br><br>What are Pakistan’s interests in Afghanistan?

a. Stable Afghanistan with a broad-based, all-inclusive neutral government, not necessarily pro-Pakistan but at  least not overtly anti-Pakistan          
b. Acceptance of Durand Line as a permanent border between the two counties<br><br>c. Stopping providing support to anti-Pakistan elements
d. Return of refugees
e. Conclusion of a water treaty for equitable distribution of the Kabul river which flows into Pakistan
f. Providing safe transit facilities for Pakistan goods to reach central Asian republics<br><br>And this quest for Pakistan to have a Strategic depth in the form of a friendly regime in a peaceful Afghanistan is not only beneficial for Pakistan to become a geo-economic power, but it will also open up new avenues for investments and markets for a landlocked Afghanistan.<br><br>Besides helping Afghanistan to become an energy corridor, it will open vast opportunities for Afghanistan to fully capitalize on the opportunities that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) provides to Islamabad &amp; the region.<br><br>7. Strategic Cordiality with Saudi Arabia

If strategic friendship with China is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy, then strategic cardinality between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia is the anchor of this policy.<br><br>Former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal once described ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia as “probably one of the closest relationships in the world between any two countries without any official treaty.”<br><br>Pakistan and Saudi Arabia cannot afford to alienate each other because of their multiple interdependencies. While Pakistan confidently depends on Saudi Arabia to bail her out whenever in economic distress, there is strong security and defence cooperation between the two countries<br><br>Saudi Arabia secretly funded Pakistan’s atomic bomb programme.; that’s why, in May 1998, Saudi Arabia was the only country that was taken in complete confidence by Prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Pakistan’s decision on performing atomic tests.<br><br>This Strategic cordiality has ensured that despite deep economic and military cooperation between them, Pakistan has always endeavoured that its relations with Iran, the arch-rival of Saudi Arabia, are never adversely influenced by the mutual animosity existing between them<br><br>Similarly, Pakistan has never pressurised Saudi Arabia in any way in the latter’s relationship with India, our arch-rival. Pakistan knows and accepts the reality that Saudis attach equal importance to both countries and will not unilaterally pressure India on Kashmir.</p>
