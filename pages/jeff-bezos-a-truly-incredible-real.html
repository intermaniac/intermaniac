#JeffBezos  #amazon #founders #amazonindia #AWS <a href="https://t.co/l91XkrFT1Q">https://t.co/l91XkrFT1Q</a><br><br>Fighting against a tide of unfavourable criticism and financial crisis. Your interest in this man and his adventure must be sparked. Let's explore a few of them.<br><br>History:

Known professionally as Jeff Bezos, Jeffrey Preston Bezos was born on January 12 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He acquired fundamental science under the strong influence of his grandfather and worked on windmills and immunized cattle during the summers.<br><br>After earning a B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Princeton University, he worked for several organisations, including Fitel, Bankers Trust, and D.E. Shaw &amp; Co. You won't be shocked to know that at the age of 30.<br><br>He was elected as the youngest Vice President in the latter. Despite seeing early success, he ultimately chose to leave the financial industry and started Amazon, an online bookshop that was formerly known as Cadabra before being renamed after Amazon.<br><br>Like most other successful digital businesses, Amazon too had its start in a garage. Also widely known is the fact that Amazon's original purpose was to be utilized only for online book sales. But Jeff saw right away that Amazon had to be an "everything" store.<br><br>Amazon went public three years later despite not generating any major profits. Market experts and analysts disapproved of this decision and predicted that Amazon would never become successful. They believed that it couldn't compete with booksellers like Barnes and Nobles.<br><br>About his Life:

This man's accomplishments and trips go on forever. As a result of its success, Amazon quickly outperformed its rivals. He launched the company's first public offering three years later.<br><br>It began selling CDs and DVDs in 1998. It added clothing to its offering in 2002. As a result, Amazon began spreading its reach to include other industries.<br><br>Bezos had been interested in space flight since he was a little boy, and he ultimately chose to investigate it. Blue Origin, an aerospace corporation, was established in 2004 to provide human access to space.<br><br>After his success, Bezos unveiled the Kindle, the device you use today to read your favourite books. The Kindle, an electronic reading gadget, claimed to impose no strain on the eyes, making books accessible to users wherever, at any time.<br><br>As a result, in 2011 the Kindle Fire was released to compete with the newly formed iPad. He started Amazon Studios in 2012. He bought the Washington Post in 2013. But hold on—not that's the end. He acquired the national grocery store chain Whole Foods.<br><br>His professional accomplishments go beyond this brief list. Amazon has done its acquisition of 114 companies till date, according to Wikipedia.

In 1993, Jeff Bezos wed MacKenzie Tuttle. He divorced in the year 2019.<br><br>Accomplishments:

Bezos has received a plethora of honours. From Carnegie Mellon University, he received an honorary doctorate in Science and Technology in 2008. Bezos was chosen by U.S. News &amp; World Report as one of the nation's top leaders.<br><br>He and Gregg Zehr were given an Innovation Award for the Amazon Kindle by The Economist three years later. He was selected Businessperson of the Year by Fortune the following year.<br><br>The National Retail Federation gave Bezos the Gold Medal Award in December 2012 and named Amazon the year's top retailer. Years 2014 through 2018, Harvard Business Review named him the world's top-performing CEO. There are several others in addition to these prominent ones.<br><br>Bezos reached the million-dollar threshold in 1997. Two years later, he was included on Forbes' list of the world's billionaires with a net worth of $10.1 billion. There were other failures and financial problems in the years that followed.<br><br>Bezos's net worth reached $30.5 billion in 2014 when a rumour that Amazon was creating a smartphone circulated. When his net worth rose to $50.3 billion a year later, Bezos climbed to the top 10.<br><br>Hours before the market closed, Bezos earned $7 billion in one hour, moving up to the fifth position in terms of wealth.
Following irregular increases in Amazon's stock price, he suddenly replaced Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the richest person in the world in July 2017.<br><br>As a result of his divorce from his wife MacKenzie Bezos in 2019, Bezos' fortune decreased. She ultimately received 25% of Bezos's Amazon shares, making her the third richest woman in the world and valuing the company at about $36 billion.<br><br>Also, the pandemic helped the company and its founder get richer since there was an increase in demand for online shopping. Currently, Jeff Bezos is the third richest person according to the Forbes billionaires list.
