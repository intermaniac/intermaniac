- harvested, because people didn't fill in the ballots properly

- machine-printed, because 107 were identical with same Biden eclipse mark

- BMD test ballots <a href="https://t.co/oSp1gJ9jfx">https://t.co/oSp1gJ9jfx</a><br><br>Suzi Voyles: They brought us our first box. And that first box had absentee-style ballots in it.

All of the ballots were suspicious.

I've done this for a long time.

And, what I mean by suspicious, it appeared that many of these had been, what I would say is, harvested.

2/13<br><br>Where I would come to your door and say, "Mr Wood, I've got your ballot for you. Would you like to vote?"

And you say, "well, I don't know who to vote for."

So you say, "I'll tell you. Well, just vote for all the Democrats."

We had one column for Johnny Isakson.

3/<br><br>It was what we call a jungle primary.

There were quite a few people in there: Republicans, Democrats, Independents.

4/<br><br>Some people had circled - this is what made me suspicious - had circled every single Democrat in that column instead of just for the office.

[In fact, out of ALL her 900 ballots, only ONE person did. See the ballot images for her batches, 28-36 ~P]

<a href="<a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a>"><a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a></a>

5/ <a href="https://t.co/z4bB02x1Ry">https://t.co/z4bB02x1Ry</a><br><br>L Todd Wood: Meaning they didn't know what they were doing.

They were told just mark the Democrats.

Suzi: Right.

[Suzi's batches also included two ballots where two Republicans were marked for the same Vote-for-One race. See batches 28-36. ~Paola]

<a href="<a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a>"><a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a></a>

6/ <a href="https://t.co/UHxRUg2kEj">https://t.co/UHxRUg2kEj</a><br><br>Suzi: E.g., if they marked Joseph Biden, down at the bottom of that column, they wrote in his name where it said Write-in.

I mean, they were totally unfamiliar.

[Out of Suzi's 900 ballots, only ONE person did. Ballot images for her batches 28-36 ~P]

<a href="<a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a>"><a href="<a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a>"><a href="https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp">https://t.co/eMgmWW4ocp</a></a></a>

6/ <a href="https://t.co/FDB9lLksMO">https://t.co/FDB9lLksMO</a><br><br>Suzi: But, I came upon a batch that I called pristine ballots.

These ballots were machine marked, and every single bubble was exactly the same, front and back, on 106 ballots.

That is totally unusual.

I'm sorry. There were 107.

7/<br><br>Suzi:  There are 110 in the total batch.

Two were for Trump, one was for Jorgensen, and the other 107 were for Biden.

[Not according to her own audit batch tally sheets, and the ballot images, which her 2 examples re-confirm were batches 28-36 from Scanner 1 ~Paola]

8/ <a href="https://t.co/2X3c90RhPr">https://t.co/2X3c90RhPr</a><br><br>Suzi: And, it would have been very improbable had they JUST been for Biden.

But, the fact that every single office on both sides, every referendum down to the Water Superintendent for the county was precisely the same.

9/<br><br>Suzi: Yes, they were machine generated. It wasn't as though somebody had took a Sharpie.

Every mark was precisely the same, including on Biden, there was a slight flaw.

10/<br><br>Suzi: I called it a little eclipse of white in the bubble where it was not totally shaded in.

And that was carried through on every ballot.

11/

[Not according to the ballot images. Showing the Presidential race on three Biden ballots for every one of Suzi's 9 batches. ~Paola] <a href="https://t.co/fjrtZujieB">https://t.co/fjrtZujieB</a><br><br>Suzi: Unbeknownst to me, there was another Fulton manager who, during the prep for the election, was told she needed to print what they were calling practice ballots to make sure the machines were calibrated correctly is what she was told.

[Suzi is referring to BMD ballots]

12/ <a href="https://t.co/3ZEBlrrDg1">https://t.co/3ZEBlrrDg1</a><br><br>Suzi: So, she was printing these ballots that somehow - and SHE did not do this - because she testified that she thought this was wrong.

I mean, her testimony perfectly corroborated my testimony. And we didn't know each other at all prior to that.
