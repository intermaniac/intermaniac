A product manager built a startup on a $38/mo tech stack with

Validation ‚ûù SurveyMonkey
Development ‚ûù Bubble
Email ‚ûù Gmail business

Cost:
NoCode ‚Äî &lt;$500
WordPress &amp; Wix ‚Äî $1000+
Programming ‚Äî $100,000+

Here‚Äôs their story! üßµ<br><br>1/ The inception of Serenifits

Serenifits' founder, Josh Hofstad is a product manager at an AI company in Berlin.

Back in 2021, the phenomenon of "Great Resignation" was sweeping the news.

Everybody was quitting and Josh was seeing this unfold first-hand.

(contd.)<br><br>Now, employees quitting in huge numbers is obviously bad news for companies:

a. It takes 23-40 days to hire a new employee
b. Companies spend more than $10K to hire them.
c. And it takes on average 90 days to onboard them completely

(contd.)<br><br>So, retaining employees by addressing their issues is always better.

Josh and his buddy quickly started brainstorming a solution to mitigate the risk of employees unexpectedly quitting.

During one of the brainstorming sessions, the idea of Serenifits was born!<br><br>2/ What exactly is Serenifits?

Serenifits is a non-intrusive way to gather and structure an employee's anonymous feedback into data.

Here's how it works:
- Every 2 weeks employees take a Heartbeat survey
- The tool aggregates the data from the survey

(contd.) <a href="https://t.co/B2LJCsgt8m">https://t.co/B2LJCsgt8m</a><br><br>- It then presents an overview of how employees feel about their work in every department

Managers can use this data to uncover trends in the company and address the most critical issues head-on<br><br>3/ Seeking validation

In the past, Josh had built a few failed ventures.

He had sunk a couple of thousand dollars into building products first before validating the idea.

So, this time instead of building the product straightaway, he first went to validate his idea.

(contd)<br><br>He paid $100 to have SurveyMonkey find survey takers in their desired demographics.

From there, they could determine that there was an actual need for the tool they were planning to buildd. 

Now, they had to find a way to buildd the tool.<br><br>4/ Problems and how did NoCode help?

Problem ‚áí Building the product takes a long time &amp; costs a lot

Now, they had validated their idea, they needed to buildd a product.

They could've created a presentation to pitch to companies. But that wouldn't have worked as well.

(contd)<br><br>And, while Josh knew how to program a little, he still needed a cheap and quick product to capitalize on the ongoing trend of "Great Resignation".

So, now he could either learn to code or buildd a product in 6 months. 

Or he could take a different route!

(contd.)<br><br>Solution ‚áí Use NoCode!

In the past, while working on those failed ventures, Josh had learned to use tools like WordPress, Wix, Google Slides and SurveyMonkey.

All these tools were great for how they were intended to be used.

(contd.)<br><br>However, they needed a tool to buildd a dashboard from scratch.

Fortunately, while working on one of his failed ventures, Josh discovered Bubble. And, he was immediately in love.

Benefits of Bubble:

1) easy learning curve
2) affordable pricing

(contd.)<br><br>3) you can buildd customizable solutions on it
4) plus, it allowed the use of APIs

They quickly built a B2B solution that fit their hypothesis. The survey tool could:

a) automatically send surveys 
b) collect and analyze the survey data
c) visualize the data

(contd.)<br><br>The survey tool had many functions, apart from these core functionalities.

Now, while Josh was building the product, his friend was setting up meetings with companies.

When the time came to demo their product, they could directly use the Serenifits demo tool.<br><br>5/ NoCode Tech Stack

1. Validation ‚ûù SurveyMonkey ‚ûù $100
2. Development ‚ûù Bubble ‚ûù $16/month 
3. Bubble Plugins ‚ûù $10/month
4. Email ‚ûù Gmail business ‚ûù $12/month
5. Domain ‚ûù $20/year

So, their one-time cost was $120 and their recurring cost was ~$38/month!

(contd.)<br><br>As opposed to this, if they had built the product in other traditional ways, it would have cost them:

WordPress or Wix - $1000+
Traditional Programming - $100,000+

Most importantly, they could create a product quickly that their users could use right away.<br><br>6/ Lessons

1) On UI and UX

With Bubble, you can create beautiful and functional UI and UX.

Today, product-led software is the standard, so one really needs to think and plan a good UI/UX.

Serenifits good UI really helped get them all those meetings.

(contd.)<br><br>2) On execution

Now, the best way to approach execution is to first set goals and work on them meticulously.

Not only these goals will guide your product development, but they'll also help you track over time what you were able to achieve.

(contd.)<br><br>3) On tracking

Data, data, data - track and measure everything that you need. 

This allows you to track progress, see how your product is being used, and make adjustments if needed.<br><br>If you liked what you read,
