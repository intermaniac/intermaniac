                      <p>I work at GitHub. I'm watching what's happening at Twitter with a combination of horror and fascination.

Let's imagine that GitHub slashed-and-burned like Twitter just did. What would happen?

(this thread is all personal opinion, nothing official here, and ♥️ to Tweeps)

1/N<br><br>(I don't think it's a wild exaggeration to say that GitHub suddenly disappearing - taking the world's open-source with it - could be a trigger for a global recession/depression.

Anyway...)

3/N<br><br>So let's imagine that GitHub suddenly got rid of somewhere between 60%-80% of its workforce, including contractors, which, once Twitter gets its responses from Elon's "Are you in for 'hardcore' work or out?" email, will end up being Twitter's fate.

3/N<br><br>Anyone who has ever worked on a large Internet-facing property knows that the reason it looks like it's always up-and-running is because there are years of engineering, and years of cultural development, put into the processes and automation that keep it running 

4/N<br><br>despite all of the problems: network interruptions, hardware failures, software bugs, dependency surprises... just so many things that put pressure on keeping that 99.999% uptime going.

5/N<br><br>In my naive younger days, I just assumed that "good code = uptime". I was SOOOO wrong. Good code is just the start. It's the corner cases, the weird bugs that you never could have imagined, the strange ways that users find the cracks in your system, that you fix and mitigate

6/N<br><br>and work around, and it takes years of running in production to get there, to give the illusion of "everything just works" while you're constantly learning new ways that things can go wrong.

Git is industrial-strength, GitHub serves 200M+ repos, and still we learn

7/N<br><br>new failure modes from our customers that we handle all the time!

And that's just for Git... we have so many different products, and they're all on that learning cycle, just like every other large system ever.

8/N<br><br>So.... let's assume that 60-80% of the GitHub workforce just disappeared in two weeks.

Let's say: all of Design, most of Product, at least half of Engineering. What would happen?

Honestly... I can only guess, but it wouldn't be good.

9/N<br><br>We'd have to put at least half of everyone left just on production on-call. That would leave very little left over for net new work.

Any new work would not have the kind of thoughtful Product and Design skills behind it that GitHub is, rightly, famous for.

10/N<br><br>Would we get Accessibility right in that new work? Who knows? In this scenario, we just fired all the people who are experts in that. Would the Design appeal to users? Who knows? We just fired all the people who are experts in that.

11/N<br><br>Would we "save money"? Sure, spending would go down, but revenue would soon follow it down as we have more outages, few new features, the bug and feature backlog grows, and what we do create isn't nearly to the standards that we've had for our entire existence.

12/N<br><br>How quickly would customers abandon Shrunken GitHub? As fast as they could. Just like advertisers are leaving Twitter.

Turning off ad spend takes much less effort than moving code + DevOps processes to a new provider (or in-house) but planning would begin immediately.

13/N<br><br>The end-result? Failure. Complete failure.

Whatever would be left of GitHub after a Twitter-like slash-and-burn would be smaller and lose all of its relevance as a leader.

And the Wall St. bean counters would probably declare it a victory for "cutting wasteful spending".

14/N<br><br>I'm a fan of Integral Philosophy. One of the foundational ideas in it is the Four Quadrants.

The idea here is that the perspectives we all already take on the world can be grouped in a 2x2 matrix of Individual vs. Collective, and Interior vs. Exterior.

15/N <a href="https://t.co/5HRgMERhms">https://t.co/5HRgMERhms</a><br><br>Some people privilege the perspectives in one quadrant over the others, effectively ignoring or collapsing the other quadrants into the one they prefer or are most comfortable with.

16/N<br><br>For example, Scientific Materialists believe that everything that is described by perspectives in the I, We, and Its quadrants are really explainable by simple scientific measurements.

17/N<br><br>In that view, sure... you have "feelings" but they're 100% reducible to It-quadrant measurements of chemicals and brain waves.

In the same way, some try to say that the only important things happen in the We-quadrant or the Its-quadrant, ignoring the importance

18/N<br><br>of individual effort and perspective.

What Elon is doing, I think, is ripping out the culture (We-quadrant) of Twitter, ignoring the Individual Interior (I-quadrant) in a "fuck your feelings" move, and claiming that the existing company structure (Its-quadrant) is broken

19/N<br><br>and making the mistake of thinking that everything can be "fixed" by ignoring the crucial perspectives in those quadrants and focusing only on the It-quadrant, which, in this case, means "we'll code our way out of it".

20/N<br><br>There is no Twitter (or GitHub) without the culture, the structure, and the people-with-real-feelings who created it.

The code is necessary but not sufficient.

Elon is about to pay $44B to learn that lesson.
