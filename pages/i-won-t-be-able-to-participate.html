                      <p>I won't be able to participate in #DEAR_ECLIPSE week on the exact days, but I'm still determined to do it when I can, so here goes the Q&amp;A thread! üåò 
#TheEclipseSeries <a href="https://t.co/zpv2E5Ewxo">https://t.co/zpv2E5Ewxo</a><br><br>7. Considering its last year of school, I doubt so. Akk, Khan and Wat will probably remain friends, they have a good relationship. Khan has especially warmed up to Ayan as well, so I won't be surprised if they become good friends too. 
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>Thua seems like he vibes with different type of ppl when it comes to friends, so they'll probably be on good terms, but just for when they meet him around Khan. 
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>8. I was pretty sure it would be Akk that does some things, but I didn't expect him doing all of it. I thought more prefects were instructed to do stuff and coordinate with each other. As for when Thua got in charge, I had my suspicions on him too
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>9. Most of the teachers, I think, are way too far gone to do a big change, but the newer ones like Sani, and the ones to come after, I sure hope are more understanding
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>10. I'd attend protests, but not talk at front. I would discuss with anyone at school, that seems able to understand, why so many things about the system are wrong and try to have a calm approach in attempt to inform more ppl without seeming like I'm attacking them
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>I'd also be vocal on social media. Would probably help draw posters and signs too haha, give me all the crafty tasks
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>11. Production-wise I beg for better matched cuts, because sometimes it's so obvious that I cannot fully concentrate on what's happening. Sound change and mismatch is also something that can be spotted a lot
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>Story-wise seeing a bit more of teacher Sani would've been nice, so we can have a stronger female character. I can always ask for more depth with topics, but gotta remember they have only a set amount of time, episodes and money, so I can't really complain too much about that.<br><br>I was hoping the cafe of diversity would become a spot we see often and have characters hold important conversations at, since it seems like a neutral, but open-minded area out of school. #DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>The World Remembers gang I think needed more fleshing out, so their cause can be taken more seriously
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>12. Chadok tries to make a change in Suppalo. Ayan has a nightmare with Akk instead of his uncle, due to his brain drawing parallels with their relationship and Chadok and Dika's. Akk is being more forward about how he feels. NO ONE DIES &lt;3
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>13. To me Khan and Thua are more of stepping stones for each other, than someone they'll spent their lives with. What they have now is what they wish it was when they were younger. 
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>But the more you grow, the more complicated things become and I think they are quite different now from the actual person they fell for years ago. Thua is not the same, neither is Khan, they don't really know each other.
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>Khan wants to be able to protect Thua, where at this point Thua has grown to not wish help, he's had enough and the times he did need help and support, he didn't really get it.
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>I think with time they'll just realize they aren't really compatible, unless they don't start communicating a ton which... Don't think will happen.
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>As for Akk and Ayan, I don't think it's even a question if they'll stay together. They can be so different, but even when they were not fully trusting of the other still, they were each other's only shoulder to cry on.
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>They made each other comfortable and safe to be vulnerable. Ayan has been rised with a mindset of trying to understand others, so he is really good at communicating and navigating emotions, which Akk could learn from and also feel stability from.
#DEAR_ECLIPSE<br><br>They both also have good intentions and I feel like one way or another, strive for similar goals. So yes, they stay together in more universes than their own I'd say. They be getting old together
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>14. A song reminding me of the show is actually Falling by Harry Styles
(I have a whole AkkAyan playlist with chill and comfy songs tho, cuz these two are my comfort)
#DEAR_ECLIPSE #TheEclipseSeries<br><br>And that was it! If anyone reached the end, you are a champ, have a cookie üç™
Doing this was so much fun, just like reading everyone else's replies. Let's have a good time doing the rest of #DEAR_ECLIPSE week, send off the series appropriately and keep the fandom moving &lt;3</p>
